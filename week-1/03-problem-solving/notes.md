A. What are problem solving techniques we know?
  - When then problem gets hard
  - make the problem smaller and isolate the hard parts
    teachers.select do |teacher|
      <!--  'avi' -->
      teacher[0] == 'a'
    end
  - making the problem less abstract
    - think the input
    def convert_to_string(array)
    # array = ['michaelangelo', 'donatello']

    end
  - rephrase the problem
  - Think about how you would solve the problem if you do not have a computer
    - Think of an analogy
    - Deconstruct how your brain/eyes are solving this problem
    - Translate this into code
