A. Pure Problem Solving
1. Restate the problem
2. Break down the problem into smaller subproblems
   write a comment
  a. Make an analogy to real life
  b. Solve the problem as if you did not have computer

B. Translating into code
Think about the data and structure that you want
  - reject information we don't need
  - coerce into the data structure we want
Try to remove the abstraction by making a concrete example




Hashketball
  - find the player with the biggest shoe size
  - most rebounds with the player of the biggest shoe size

  list -> array
  You want a list of players
  then you want that player's attributes
  Then get the shoe size
