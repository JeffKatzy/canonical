1. What we know about objects?
  - How do we use them?
  - What are they good for?
  - What is an object?
  - Why not just use a hash???


  Data and methods all in one package
  A defined thing
  From outside the object, I can refer to everything the object contains -?
  Information that can be acted upon

  It is a simulation of something...

  Modeled after cells
    - encapsulation
    - yet communication




2. Why do we even need objects?
3. Object mechanics
  I. Object instances
  - object lifecycle
  - instance methods
  - instance variables
  - scope
  II. Class methods and class variables
  III. self-referencing with objects
